# Kaggle - Titanic Competition

> Hi, if you want you can check my profile at Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/daniarlert).

This repository contains my submission for the famous Titanic competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to predict if a passenger survived or not based on a set of features.

This notebook is just a simple approach to the problem, since my main goal was to learn how to participate in Kaggle competitions so if you are searching for a high score this is not the notebook for you.
